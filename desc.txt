I need to do a bitcoin price prediction project based on the sentiment analysis so i will give you a link to a dataset that contains tweets and their polarity [pos,neg,neutral] all i want is to train this dataset. Then fetch tweets in real time from twitter to build another dataset (the test dataset) , the conclusion will be lets say the newly built dataset got a 50% pos, 30% neg and 20% neutral so we say that it's predicted that the price will increase in that day so its an estimation and no need for specific number for the price. The approach here is important so i want Naive bayes, SVM then a hybrid of both of these and a comparison for their accuracy (all i know for now is that the hybrid approach will result in a better accuracy)
